# BART Ridership Narrative Visualization

NetId: Kdewitt3
Student Name: Kathryn DeWitt
Course: CS416 Data Visualization

## Introduction

## Messaging

> What is the message you are trying to communicate with the narrative visualization?

The message I am trying to communicate with the narrative visualization is that BART ridership has dropped off due to the pandemic. The user can explore this trend by county and station.

## Narrative Structure

> Which structure was your narrative visualization designed to follow (martini glass, interactive slide show or drop-down story)? How does your narrative visualization follow that structure? (All of these structures can include the opportunity to "drill-down" and explore. The difference is where that opportunity happens in the structure.)

- martini glass

## Visual Structure

> What visual structure is used for each scene? How does it ensure the viewer can understand the data and navigate the scene? How does it highlight to urge the viewer to focus on the important parts of the data in each scene? How does it help the viewer transition to other scenes, to understand how the data connects to the data in other scenes?

- would like a train to transition to other scenes...

## Scenes

> What are the scenes of your narrative visualization?  How are the scenes ordered, and why

## Annotations

> What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are the annotations used to support the messaging? Do the annotations change within a single scene, and if so, how and why

- TODO: template definition?
- Annotation: text describing scene

## Parameters

> What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the narrative visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?

- Scene #
- County
- Station
- Year

## Triggers

> What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the narrative visualization?

- affordance lets user know how to interact w/ them
- need data pt/city name in tool tip
- need ability to highlight county

### TODO LIST

1. Get data in a line graph separated by station
2. Get data in a line graph separated by county
